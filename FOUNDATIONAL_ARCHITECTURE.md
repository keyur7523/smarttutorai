# 🏗️ Foundational Architecture Implementation

## ✅ **COMPLETE: Foundational Architecture Implemented Without Touching UI**

The foundational architecture has been successfully implemented according to your exact specifications **while preserving the existing UI completely**.

---

## 📋 **Implementation Summary**

### ✅ **1. Project Setup**
- **Next.js 14** with TypeScript ✓
- **Zustand** for state management ✓
- **Lucide React** for icons ✓
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling ✓
- **@radix-ui/react-*** components ✓

### ✅ **2. File Structure**
```

│   ├── api/
│   │   ├── tutor/route.ts ✓
│   │   ├── plan/route.ts ✓
│   │   └── hint/route.ts ✓
│   ├── learn/page.tsx ✓ (UI preserved)
│   ├── summary/page.tsx ✓ (UI preserved)
│   ├── page.tsx ✓ (UI preserved)
│   ├── layout.tsx ✓ (UI preserved)
│   └── globals.css ✓ (UI preserved)
├── components/ ✓ (All UI components preserved)
├── lib/ ✓ (Updated to specifications)
├── store/ ✓ (Updated to specifications)
├── public/
│   └── problems.json ✓ (30 fraction problems)
└── package.json ✓
```

### ✅ **3. State Management (Zustand)**
**File**: `store/session.ts`
- ✅ Exact interface implemented
- ✅ `currentLevel: 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'`
- ✅ `history: HistoryItem[]`
- ✅ `problemStartAt: number | null`
- ✅ `recentProblemIds: string[]`
- ✅ `judgeMode: boolean`
- ✅ `problems: Problem[]`
- ✅ All required actions implemented

### ✅ **4. Types (store/types.ts)**
**Exact types implemented:**
```typescript
export type Level = 'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard'

export interface Problem {
  id: string
  stem: string
  type: 'mcq' | 'short'
  choices?: string[]
  answer_key: string[]
  level: Level
  topic: string
  hints: string[]
}

export interface HistoryItem {
  problemId: string
  levelAtTime: Level
  correct: boolean
  timeMs: number
  usedHint: boolean
  submittedAt: number
}
```

### ✅ **5. Adaptive Logic (lib/adapt.ts)**
**Exact adaptation strategy implemented:**
- ✅ Start at Medium level
- ✅ Medium → Hard: 2 consecutive correct
- ✅ Hard → Medium: 2 consecutive wrong OR 3 total wrong
- ✅ Medium → Easy: 2 consecutive wrong OR 3 total wrong
- ✅ Easy → Medium: 2 consecutive correct
- ✅ `getNextLevel(current: Level, history: HistoryItem[]): Level` exported

### ✅ **6. Problem Data (public/problems.json)**
**30 fraction problems created:**
- ✅ 10 Easy (e1-e10): Basic operations
- ✅ 10 Medium (m1-m10): Mixed operations
- ✅ 10 Hard (h1-h10): Complex problems
- ✅ Each problem has: id, stem, type, choices, answer_key, level, topic, hints

### ✅ **7. Session Management**
- ✅ No persistence (fresh start each session)
- ✅ `clearSession()` resets everything to initial state
- ✅ 10 questions per session
- ✅ Track recent problem IDs to avoid repeats (last 5)

### ✅ **8. API Routes**
- ✅ `/api/tutor` - Adaptive level determination
- ✅ `/api/plan` - Problem selection with recent ID filtering
- ✅ `/api/hint` - Hint generation system

### ✅ **9. Library Files**
- ✅ `lib/adapt.ts` - Adaptive learning algorithms
- ✅ `lib/check.ts` - Answer validation and feedback
- ✅ `lib/utils.ts` - Utility functions
- ✅ All imports and exports correct

---

## 🎯 **Key Features Implemented**

### **Adaptive Learning System**
- Intelligent difficulty adjustment based on performance
- Tracks consecutive correct/wrong answers
- Prevents problem repetition (last 5 problems)
- Session-based learning (10 problems per session)

### **Problem Management**
- 30 carefully crafted fraction problems
- Multiple choice and short answer types
- Progressive difficulty (Easy → Medium → Hard)
- Rich hint system for each problem

### **State Management**
- Zustand store with exact interface
- Session tracking and history
- Performance metrics
- No persistence (fresh start each session)

### **API Integration**
- RESTful endpoints for tutoring logic
- Problem selection with filtering
- Hint generation system
- Adaptive level determination

## 🚀 **Build Status**

- ✅ **Build Successful**: `npm run build` completes without errors
- ✅ **No Linting Errors**: All code follows best practices
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript implementation
- ✅ **UI Preserved**: All existing UI components unchanged

---

## 🎨 **UI Preservation**

**CRITICAL**: The existing UI has been completely preserved:
- ✅ All components remain unchanged
- ✅ Design system maintained
- ✅ User experience preserved
- ✅ Visual styling intact
- ✅ Interactive elements functional

---

## 📝 **Next Steps**

The foundational architecture is now complete and ready for:
1. **Feature Development**: Add new features using the established patterns
2. **UI Integration**: Connect new features to existing UI components
3. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing
4. **Deployment**: Deploy to production

---

## 🔧 **Usage**

The system is now ready to use:

1. **Start Development**: `npm run dev`
2. **Build for Production**: `npm run build`
3. **Access Application**: http://localhost:3000

The adaptive tutoring system will:
- Start at Medium level
- Adapt difficulty based on performance
- Track progress and history
- Provide hints and feedback
- Manage sessions (10 problems each)
