## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Installation**
```bash
npm install
```

### **Development**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### **Testing (TestSprite Integration)**
```bash
npm run test              # Run all tests
npm run test:watch        # Continuous testing
npm run test:coverage     # Generate coverage report
npm run test:ui           # Visual test interface
```

### **TestSprite Integration Setup**
```bash
# 1. Get API key from TestSprite dashboard

# 2. Create .env with your API key:
TESTSPRITE_API_KEY=your_key_here

# 3. Start the development server:
npm run dev

# 4. Visit the testing dashboard to see TestSprite integration:
#    http://localhost:3000/testing
```

**📖 Environment setup:** See `ENV_SETUP.md` for environment variable configuration.

### **Performance Analysis**
```bash
npm run analyze           # Bundle and performance analysis
```

### **Instrumentation**
We use TestSprite to log LLM generations, validation errors, repair attempts, and basic quality metrics. This satisfies the hackathon sponsor-usage requirement without altering UI/UX. The integration degrades gracefully when the API key is not provided.
